Imran has many friends. But all his friends live in different cities. 
He wants to visit the maximum number of them. However there is a catch. 

All the cities that his friends live in are arranged in form of a square. A city can have more than one friends. He wants to visit the 
maximum number of his friends. But in the grid of the cities, he can only travel once diagonally(Right diagonal). Also he can teleport 
between the cities belonging to the same diagonal. There is one more catch though. He can only visit a city in which the number of friends
is more than or equal to the number of friends in the city he previously visited.

Your work is to print the row and column indexes of the cities that he needs to visit so that he can visit maximum number of his friends.
